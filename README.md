level-edit
==========

A plain old level editor which can create/edit tilemaps and place game objects on the map.
Written in Java.

Features:
* If you need a simple level editor for placing out game objects and editing tiles it may do. :)
* You can quite easily write your own file format plug in for exporting to your game.

Todos:
It's based on some really old code from the J2ME days so there are some refactorings left to do:
* Some Json or XML based file formats instead of old home-made format.
* Fix quirks in GUI.
* Some config values still hard-coded in java.
* Support extending level formats with external libs.
* Tutorial on how to set it up.

Usage:
There is an example project setup that should be loaded as default. 
example.config is documented, which gives some tips on how to setup a project.
